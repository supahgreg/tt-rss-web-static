# Published Articles

You can publish selected articles to a special RSS feed, accessible to anyone
who knows the special randomly-generated URL. This works independently of
[GeneratedFeeds](GeneratedFeeds.md) which allows you to share entire feeds,
categories, etc.

You can mark articles as published by clicking [standard feed
icon](http://feedicons.com/) near headline title:

![](../images/publish_articles.png)

Resulting URL is displayed in Preferences (`Feeds` &rarr; `Published & shared articles`).

You can also publish articles automatically using filters (`Action` &rarr; `Publish article`).
